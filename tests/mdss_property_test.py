Test 1: _add_reference_to_protein_data()
        I checked this in protein data, do I need to test it also here?

Test 2: discretize_vector()

Test 3: _property_statistics()
        There are built it functions, I think there is no need to check them.

Test 4: set_reference_coordinates()
        This is part of mda library, does it need to be tested?

Test 5: write_property_vector()
        Test if the property vector is written. Do we still have a property vector does this need to change?

Test 6: write_property_discretised_vector()
        Same as test 5
