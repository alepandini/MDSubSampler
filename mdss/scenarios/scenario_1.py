Scenario 001 

Purpose:             Given a single MD trajectory sampling different global 
                     conformations of the protein, select the smallest subset 
                     of frames with a similar distribution of RMSD 
                     
User:                Molecular dynamics user with basic understanding of coding
    
Input:               Molecular dynamics trajectory 
                     Reference structure [optional] 
                     Range of subsample sizes (or percentages) 
                     Dissimilarity threshold [optional] 

Sampling strategy:   Random sampling 

Type of property:    Numerical continuous 

Property dependency: Dependent on single frame 

Criterion:           Dissimilarity between distributions of values of original 
                     and subsampled property 
Scenario:	
                    1. Read input trajectory and topology files 
                    2. Read list of subsample sizes â€“ start from smaller size 
                    3. Calculate RMSD distribution for input trajectory 
                    4. Random subsample 
                    5. Calculate RMSD distribution for subsampled trajectory 
                    6. Calculate dissimilarity measure between distributions 
                    7. If dissimilarity is not below threshold, repeat steps 4 to 7 
                       for next subsample size in the list
